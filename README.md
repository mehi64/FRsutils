# Fuzzy-Rough set utilities [Under development]

A basic Python library needed for fuzzy rough set calculations that are used in research, e.g.:

- lower approximation
- upper approximation
- positive region
- boundry region

## Fuzzy-rough oversampling
### FRSMOTE
- Compatible with scikit learn and its pipeline

## Notes (considerations on using FRsutils)
- All functions expect to get normalized scalar of normalized numpy arrays.
- Make sure the input dataset is normalized. This library expects all inputs to all functions are in range [0,1]
- This library will use all features of data instances to calculate the fuzzzy-rough measures.
- All datasets have 2 classes.
- Positive region, lower approximation, upper approximation,etc are calculated based on the class of each instance. Therefore, maximum calculations in POS is ignored and POS is equal to lower approximation value.

## Docs
- We use Doxygen-style (Javadoc-like) Python Docstrings and documents are generated by Doxygen
- To see online documentations, please visit [online documentations](https://mehi64.github.io/FRsutils/)

## How to run tests
These are two ways:
- use pytest and it finds and runs all tests
- If you want to run tests in debug mode, find and run the file experimental_tests.py (Make sure all functions in test files are called in this file. Maybe some are forgotten)
- For more information on test procedures, please refer to [test procedures](tests/test_procedures.md)

## Technical decisions justification
- Since data checking slows down the running of experiments, we don't check if data is in the correct range in each function.

## TODO:
- Add tests for tnorms with non-binary masks
- Implemene and debug VQRS (Vaguely Quantified Rough Sets)
- Change the code to get a class to calculate lower and upper approximations + POS regarding a single class of Y.
