# Fuzzy-Rough utilities (Under development)

A basic Python library needed for fuzzy rough set calculations e.g.:

- lower approximation
- upper approximation
- positive region

## Algorithgms and containings

- Implicators
  - Gaines
  - Goedel
  - Kleeneâ€“Dienes
  - Reichenbach
  - Lukasiewicz
- T-norms
  - min tnorm
  - product tnorm
- OWAFRS (Ordered Weighted Average Fuzzy-Rough Sets) 
- VQRS (Vaguely Quantified Rough Sets)
- ITFRS (Implicator/T-norm Fuzzy-Rough Sets)

## Notes
- All functions expect to get normalized scalar of normalized numpy arrays.
- Make sure the input dataset is normalized. This library expects all inputs to all functions are in range [0,1]
- This library will use all features of data instances to calculate the fuzzzy-rough measures.


## Some technical information to remember
### tnorms
- works on 1D vectors (for aggregating the values to a scalar in similarity calculations)
- works on nxnx2 maps for fast calculations
- min tnorm and product tnorm will act the same if one of the input parameters takes the binary values; So, no matter which one you use, they provide the same reults
- implicators work on scalar but can be vectorized with np.vectorize()

| sim (x,y) | A(y) | Gaines | Goedel | KD | Reichenbach | Luk |
|------|------|------|------|------|------|------|
| 0.8   |  0.0   |  0.0  |  0.0  |  0.2   |  0.2   |  0.2  | 
|  x   |  x   |  x   |  x   |  x   |  x   |  x   | 

where x, y are two data instances; A(y) means if the instance y has the same class as X and returns 0.0 or 1.0. 

## Docs
- We use Doxygen-style (Javadoc-like) Python Docstrings and documents are generated by Doxygen

## How to run tests
These are two ways:
- use pytest and it finds and runs all tests
- If you want to run tests in debug mode, find and run the file experimental_tests.py (Make sure all functions in test files are called in this file. Maybe some are forgotten)

## TODO:
- Add tests for tnorms with non-binary masks
