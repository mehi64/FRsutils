please check the file syntetic_data_for_tests.py. This file contains a set of precalculated values for comparing against the outputs of tnorms, implicators, etc. Please give me some hints on making it better for ptyest unit tests. Please check tnorms.py and implicators.py and if important, then customize your hints based on these classes as well. Moreover, I will add more data to this class for new future classes and for each class, I have to be able to add more data. This means I will have more than one set data for testing the same class.
