implicators work on scalar but can be vectorized with np.vectorize()


build project:
pip install build twine

goto root of the project containing (FRsutils, images, tests, etc.)

python -m build

NOTICE:
TO TEST INSTALLATION LOCALLY:

pip install .
check if the library is importable and working. Then remove it with command
pip uninstall FRsutils


Upload to PyPi
twine upload dist/*
I have a file with my token


Installation and remove from PyPi
pip install FRsutils

pip uninstall Frsutils
==================================================
unit testing

- we use pytest
- for testing those conditionss throwing exception the best practice is to use "pytest.raises" function
- It is great if you run pytest in debug mode. But we did not do that yet
